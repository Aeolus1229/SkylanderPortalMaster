# Skylander Portal Master
---
Fork of https://github.com/SigmaDolphin/SkylanderEditor

Which is much more cohesive and feature rich - this is for specific use cases.

## Uses
 - Simple Portal reading tool
 - Stores current Skylander Figure in ActiveSkylander.json in the root folder
 - yeah thats about it!

### This is about as far as you can get from "Feature Rich"
This program reads one skylander and writes its name element and ID to a file- that is It, and this program will probably never do much more than that. 

#### Planned Features
 - Multiple Skylander support
 - Swap Force
 - Traps
 - Items/Vehicles
 - Full data dump in json
